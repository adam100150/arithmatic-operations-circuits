# verilog-projects
A repository with a variety of adder, subtractor and multiplyer circuits written in behavioral verilog.
To run these projects you will need `iverilog` which you can download from `brew` on Mac. To test a specific circuit you can run:
```
source tests/<name-of-circuit>-test.sh
```

## Circuits Currenlty Implemented
* Four Bit Ripple Carry Adder
* Four Bit Subtractor
